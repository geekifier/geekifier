## Hello, fellow human! üëã

I am a hands-on platform engineer with experience across a wide spectrum of technologies.  
This includes 10+ years working with AWS, enjoying working in both architecture and delivery roles.

üîéüíº

Currently, I am looking for a new opportunity, where I could contribute my passion for automation and process improvements, as well as my broad experience in the industry.

You can read more about my professional experience on my [LinkedIn Profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kamilmarkowicz/), and see the [contributions](https://github.com/geekifier/geekifier/edit/master/README.md#contributions) section to review some of my work.

Some of the technologies I have experience with:

- AWS Cloud
- Terraform + other parts of Hashicorp stack
- AWS CDK (TypeScript)
- Ansible
- CI/CD (Gitlab, Github, Jenkins, Azure DevOps)
- Kubernetes, DC/OS (Mesosphere), and other container orchestrators
- Linux systems management

And what I am interested in working on:

- Automating platform and infra delivery
- Creating abstractions and tooling to automate, reduce friction, and make DEV and OPS team more productive
- Providing tooling and platforms to ensure uptime and performance
- Optimizing for performance and cost
- Assesing, enhancing and maintainig platform and process security

### Contributions

Majority of my contributions are in private and propriatery codebases. However, I have a track record of Open Source contributions to relevant tooling including Code PRs to Terragrunt, as well as numerous confirmed bug reports across a number of tools.

While I cannot share much of the code I have worked on, I am happy to reference my notes and discuss my implementation experience.

### What I'm working on right now üßë‚Äçüíª

Having worked with AWS CDK for the past couple years, and having _really_ enjoyed the TypeScript development experience - I am looking back on my Terraform experience and reflecting on we can do things better.

I am also working on some interesting Kubernetes-related projects, more to come.

### Interests outside of tech

I am (un)fortunate to have many hobbies and interests, but lately I have been working on:
- 3D Printing and Modeling - check out my [printables.com profile](https://www.printables.com/@geekifier).
- Home Improvement - I like building things (see the pattern yet?)
- Trying to do a good job as a parent üòÖ
