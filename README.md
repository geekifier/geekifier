## Hello, fellow human! ðŸ‘‹

I am a hands-on platform engineer with experience across a wide spectrum of technologies.  
This includes 10+ years working with AWS, enjoying working in both architecture and delivery roles.

ðŸ”ŽðŸ’¼

Currently, I am looking for a new opportunity, where I could contribute my passion for automation and process improvements, as well as my broad experience in the industry.

You can read more about my experience on my [LinkedIn Profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kamilmarkowicz/).

Some of the technologies I have experience with:
- AWS Cloud
- Terraform + other parts of Hashicorp stack
- AWS CDK (TypeScript)
- Ansible
- CI/CD (Gitlab, Github, Jenkins, Azure DevOps)
- Kubernetes, DC/OS (Mesosphere), and other container orchestrators
- Linux systems management

### Contributions

Majority of my contributions are in private and propriatery codebases. However, I have a track record of Open Source contributions to relevant tooling including Code PRs to Terragrunt, as well as numerous confirmed bug reports across a number of tools.

While I cannot share much of the code I have worked on, I am happy to reference my notes and discuss my implementation experience.

### Currently I am working on

Having worked with AWS CDK for the past couple years, and having _really_ enjoyed the TypeScript development experience - I am looking back on my Terraform experience and reflecting on we can do things better.
